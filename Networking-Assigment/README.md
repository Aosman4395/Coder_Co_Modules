# üñ•Ô∏è Networking Assignment ‚Äî AWS EC2, Nginx, and Custom Domain Setup

## üìò Overview
This assignment demonstrates how I set up an AWS EC2 instance, installed and configured Nginx, and connected it to a custom domain purchased from Namecheap.  
The project shows my understanding of how networking, DNS, and server configurations work together to host a functional website on the cloud.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu Linux)** ‚Äî Virtual machine hosting the web server  
- **Nginx** ‚Äî Web server software  
- **Namecheap** ‚Äî Domain registrar  
- **SSH** ‚Äî Secure access to the EC2 instance  
- **Windows Terminal & Ubuntu VM** ‚Äî Used for connection and installation  
- **GitHub** ‚Äî Documentation and version control

## üèóÔ∏è Project Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up EC2 Instance
I started by launching an **Ubuntu EC2 instance** on AWS.  
During setup, I:
- Selected a key pair and downloaded the `.pem` file for SSH access.  
- Allowed **inbound rules** for **SSH (port 22)** and **HTTP (port 80)**.  
- Ensured **outbound rules** allowed all traffic.  

Initially, I had a problem connecting to the instance because the **Network ACL (NACL)** was blocking SSH. After editing the NACL to allow inbound and outbound SSH traffic, the connection worked.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to the Instance Using SSH
Before connecting, I made sure I was in the same directory as my `.pem` file.  
Then I ran:

```bash
cd /path/to/pemfile
ssh -i n-assignment.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>

### **Section 5 ‚Äî Step 3 & 4: Domain & Elastic IP**

```markdown
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Purchase and Configure Domain
After confirming my instance was running, I purchased a domain from **Namecheap** ‚Äî `ahmedo.co.uk`.  
I then created a subdomain called **nginx.ahmedo.co.uk** and set up the DNS configuration:  
- Type: **A Record**  
- Host: **nginx**  
- Value: **Elastic IP address** of my EC2 instance  
- TTL: **Automatic**

This linked my domain name to my EC2 instance‚Äôs IP address.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Allocate Elastic IP
I assigned an **Elastic IP** to my EC2 instance to ensure it kept the same public IP even if the instance restarted.  
This was necessary for the domain connection to stay consistent.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Nginx (Troubleshooting Process)
I first tried installing Nginx from my **Ubuntu VM** (running on my Windows laptop) after SSH‚Äôing into the EC2 instance.  
Even though the network settings looked correct, the installation failed ‚Äî I kept getting errors like:

> ‚ÄúE: Unable to locate package nginx‚Äù

I then switched to my **Windows Terminal** and SSH‚Äôd into the EC2 instance using the same key.  
From there, the commands worked perfectly, and Nginx installed successfully.

```bash
ssh -i n-assignment.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx

### **Section 7 ‚Äî Step 6: Customize Page & Reload Nginx**

```markdown
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Customize the Web Page
When I visited the domain, it initially showed the **default Nginx page**, and I couldn‚Äôt edit it because of permissions and default configuration restrictions.  
To fix this, I removed the default file and created my own **custom HTML file**.

```bash
# Remove default Nginx page
sudo rm /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

# Create your custom HTML page
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

---

### **Section 8 ‚Äî Step 7: Test Domain Connection**

```markdown
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Domain Connection
To confirm the connection between my domain and EC2 instance, I used the following commands:

```bash
nslookup nginx.ahmedo.co.uk
dig nginx.ahmedo.co.uk
curl nginx.ahmedo.co.uk
